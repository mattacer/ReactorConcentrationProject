# Membrane Plug Flow Reactor Concentration Project
## Brief Description
This was a project and report completed as part of a Chemical Engineering 109 (Numerical and Mathematical Methods) course that modeled and analyzed the concentration profiles of chemical species within a membrane plug flow reactor(PFR) based on their accumulation, reaction kinetics, and mass diffusion. See the [report.pdf](./report.pdf) file for an overview of what the code in this repository does and how it was written.
